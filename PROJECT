📌 Final Project Proposal 
🏥 Project Title

Hospital Patient Record Analyzer

🔍 Problem Statement

Hospitals collect large amounts of patient information, but raw data is difficult to read and understand. Medical staff need fast and clear summaries of patient visits, doctor workloads, 
and basic patient demographics to make better decisions. This project solves that by organizing patient visit records, searchable patient IDs, and statistical summaries like average age and top visitors.

🎯 Project Description

The Hospital Patient Record Analyzer is a Python-based program that reads patient information 
from a JSON file (hospital.json). It organizes data such as patient_id, number of visits, doctors consulted, and patient age.
The system allows users to search for patients, find the most visited doctor, identify which patient has the highest 
number of visits,and compute the average age of patients.Its main goal is to help users analyze hospital data through basic 
Python operations such as loops, conditions, and JSON handling, while demonstrating how organized data can support hospital decision-making.

⚙️ Planned Features
1.) Show full patient records

Displays all patients’ names, patient_ids, number of visits, and doctors consulted.

2.) Search patient by patient_id

Asks the user to input a patient_id, searches the dataset, and shows the patient's details if found.
If no match is found, displays "Patient not found."

3.) Show most visited doctor

Calculates which doctor has the highest total visits.

Equation used:

total_visits_doctor = sum(patient_visits)

4.) Show patient with the most visits

Identifies the patient with the highest number of hospital visits and displays their name and total visits.

6.) Show average age of patients

Computes the average age of all patients in the dataset.

Equation used:

average_age = total_age_of_all_patients / number_of_patients

7.) Exit program

Ends the program.

🧠 Logic Plan (UPDATED)
Option 1: Updated Pseudocode
Start Program
Load JSON file "hospital.json"

Repeat:

    Display menu:
        1. Show all patient records
        2. Search patient by patient_id
        3. Show most visited doctor
        4. Show patient with most visits
        5. (Removed)
        6. Show average age of patients
        7. Exit program

    Ask user for choice

    IF choice == 1:
        Display all patient records

    ELSE IF choice == 2:
        Ask for patient_id (input)
        Search patient list
        IF found:
            Display patient details
        ELSE:
            Display "Patient not found"

    ELSE IF choice == 3:
        For each doctor:
            Add up total visits across all patients
        Doctor with highest total = most visited doctor
        Display result

    ELSE IF choice == 4:
        Find patient with highest visit count
        Display patient name + visits

    ELSE IF choice == 6:
        Add all patient ages
        Compute average age = total ages / number of patients
        Display average age

    ELSE IF choice == 7:
        Break loop and exit

    ELSE:
        Display "Invalid choice"

Repeat until choice == 7

End Program
